README

Pledge: “I affirm that I did not give or receive any 
unauthorized help on this project, and that all work will is my own.”

Source: Prof. St. Jacques’ lecture slides and lecture code were my main and only source for this project. 


Project Description:

Below is a description of each of my project 3 features. Each feature/view is linked from a main home screen, all accessed using a navigation controller. My goal for this project was to maintain the ski resort theme, but mainly implement topics from lecture since project 2. 

1. About, lodges, hills: 3 separate views for viewing static information about the app and the Ski Resort. 
2. Ski Web Browser: enter a URL to access a webpage and navigate it. Use the “go” button. An invalid URL will not change the current web page. 
3. View Image from URL: Enter an image URL to load and view it. The exact image URL must be pasted in. A skiing default image will persist until a valid image URL is entered and loaded. 
4. Drawing: Entertainment portion of the app. Users can draw lines or squiggles, or erase all points. Different colors can be used. 
5. Gestures: Phone too cold while outside skiing? Test it and warm it up using the gestures view. The tap gesture recognizer will process dragging and different taps. 
6. Wind Checker: The goal is to enter a valid US city and state separated by a comma to access the wind conditions there. I implemented the model and view for this, but there is an issue in accessing the exact data from the Yahoo weather-wind API.

Development: 
In order to complete this assignment, I referred to the lecture slides and my previous homework assignments. I coded this assignment in the Swift 3 Language in the Xcode 8 IDE. I did not use any outside sources. I tested my app on the iPhone 5SE, 7, and 7plus simulators. 

Files:
All files for my project 3 are included in the PROJECT folder. Sample output screenshots of my app running are in SampleOutput. My proposal is included in doc and PDF form.
